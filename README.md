mingle
======
[PAUSED DEVELOPMENT - 08/06/2014]

Mingle is an iOS application intended to allow users to generate events and create groups with random people so no one has to go anywhere alone. It allows user's to create groups of arbitrary size, create events to be viewed in a swiping manner (e.g. Tinder), and collaborate with group members via integrated group chats, or the sharing of user information (which can be privatized).

Progress
--------
Note a member of the team had to leave, and the project is a bit too much work for just myself to do (along with the work of college and other projects) so mingle is on a relatively permanent hiatus.
